Week #1 SummaryI completed 7.46% of my currently scoped work in 9.7% of the total anticipated time. The work I completed this week took 1.3 times longer than I anticipated.At this point, I have a task diagram that clearly outlines the flow of my program between different entities such as timers, tasks, and ISRs. Although the global variables are not known in their entirety yet, the flow of data is still relatively clear upon looking at the diagram. Additionally, ITC implementation is clearly shown. This diagram will be updated as I move through the project and refine global variables and ITC.I spent more time than expected on the task diagram because I ended up reading the requirements doc multiple times to understand what functionality was required.I created a risk register and identified two real risks that could arise in the coming month.The risk register ended up being easier than I expected and took less time. Turns out it’s stupid easy to come up with ways that the project could be killed.I created a deliverables table with what will be completed week by week and an estimate of how long each task will take.The deliverable table took the amount of time expected.I identified two cutting points shown on my task diagram. One of them is designed to ensure proper function of the event flag set upon the press and then again on the release of one of the buttons. As this is a tricky implementation with conditionals within an ISR and two separate event flags, I want to nail this down. The other is put in place to verify that the proper event flags are being set according to different conditions in the physics task. This is a crucial part of the program and without it, there would be incorrect display updates.Summarizing my work meant making this document and took the amount of time expected.
